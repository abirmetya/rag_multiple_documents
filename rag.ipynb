It is a significant and urgent issue that is primarily driven by human activities, such as the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The Earth's climate is changing at a rapid pace, leading to a rise in global mean temperature, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and potential sea-level rise.\n",

Climate change poses severe risks to biodiversity, water resources, agriculture, and human health, among other aspects of life on Earth.\n",
